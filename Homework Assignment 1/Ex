#Differences: SVD and EVD differ in dimension. For SVD you'll need a orthonormal frame, in EVD you don't need a basis which is orthonormal. [1]

#Similarities:
[2] For a symmetric matrix, EVD and SVD are the same.

#Correlation, look more at the difference in light. A picture with approx.
#the same amount of light results in a high similarity. 
#Correlation also really looks at specific facial features. Like someone is smiling in the picture results in high similarities.
#Which gives in our opinion the best results. 
#SMC and Cosine are very similar, they both use the overall light or contrast as a similarity measure.
