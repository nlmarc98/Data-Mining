Because of the removal of the outliers in your data, we got normally looking boxplots and histrograms, because now the data isn't
heavily influenced by the outliers anymore, and thus the outliers don't skew your data very heavy anymore.

Fixed acidity: We have a small/weak negative correlation (-0.0777), which is significant (p<0.05). Thus fixed acidity isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Volatile acidity: We have a small/weak negative correlation (-0.2623), which is significant (p<0.05). Thus volatile acidity also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Critric acid:
We have a small/weak positive correlation (0.0890), which is significant(p<0.05).  Thus critic acid also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Residual sugar:
We have a small/weak negative correlation (-0.0321), which is significant (p<0.05). Thus residual sugar also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Chlorides:
We have a small/weak negative correlation (-0.1991), which is significant (p<0.05). Thus chlorides also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Free sulfur dioxide:
We have a small/weak positive correlation (0.0552), which is significant(p<0.05).  Thus free sulfur dioxode also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Total sulfur dioxide:
We have a small/weak negative correlation (-0.0397), which is significant (p<0.05). Thus sulfur dioxide also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.

Density:
We have a medium negative correlation (-0.3169), which is very significant (p<0.05). Thus density is of quite  influence with respect to the quality of a wine. Thus a lower density gives higher scores.

PH:
We have a non-significant positive correlation, so with respect to the quality of wine, this one isn't of real influence.

Sulphates:
We have a small/weak positive correlation (0.0380), which is significant(p<0.05).  Thus sulphates also isn't of much influence with respect to the quality of a wine.


Alcohol:
We have a medium positve correlation (0.4495), which is very significant (p<0.05). Thus alcohol is of quite  influence with respect to the quality of a wine. Thus a higer alcohol percentage in the wine, creates higher scores.


Thus only alcohol and density are of real contribution to the quality of the wine. 
For alcohol the values which represent the higher quality scores fall between the 9% and 13% alcohol percentage, when you look at the graph.
For density, all the bars fall clearly between the 0.990 and 1.000, when you look at the graph. Thus scores between 0.990 and 1.000 are associated with higher quality scores.
